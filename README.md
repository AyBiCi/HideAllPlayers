# HideAllPlayers
Bukkit plugin for hiding players for you.

Many people needs this functionality on their servers, so they rewrite all the time functions needed for it and I'm not really a fan of it. This implementation is very simple, only one small class. It was inspired by https://github.com/tim03we/HideAllPlayers, but that version is for Minecraft Bedrock, this one is for bukkit.

There are this two simple commands that player can use for showing and hiding players:

/showplayers - shows players
/hideplayers - hides players
